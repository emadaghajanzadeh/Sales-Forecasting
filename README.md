# Sales_Forecasting_RNN

## Description
This project was given in the neural network course to help students better understand time series prediction and get hands-on experience on building recurring neural networks for a particular dataset. The dataset consists of a market's sales amount from 1992 to 2020, and the task was to predict the sales pattern in the last 12 months (during 2019) given the previous records (1992 to 2019) as training data.
